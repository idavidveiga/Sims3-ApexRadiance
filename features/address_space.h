// Address-space monitor (development build; docs/features/frame-profiler.md, "Address space").
//
// TS3W is a 32-bit, large-address-aware game: 4 GB of addresses. When no large enough contiguous piece is left, big
// allocations fail (the save's "Error 12", DXVK's texture mappings, the script heap's growth). A helper thread walks the
// address space with VirtualQuery every 10 s (about 1-3 ms, off the game's threads) and keeps: free total and largest free
// block (below / above 2 GB), the five largest free blocks, reserved and committed memory by kind (images, mapped views,
// private; private executable = the script GC heap), allocations by size class, the loaded images by size, the game
// allocator's own big blocks (count and bytes at [[0x011CB864]+0x488 / +0x48C]) and the session minimum of the largest
// free block with its time. One log line a minute ([AddressSpace]); the full table goes into the frame profiler report.
