//   Pending holder ([scene+8], 0x68 bytes, ctor 0x006E4530): +0x04..+0x08 the slot array of its nodes, +0x18 counter
//   (nodes processed by the last drain; not a list size: nothing else counts the list), +0x20 / +0x24 the sentinel
//   {next, prev} of a circular intrusive list of pending scene nodes, +0x2C the spatial tree. VERIFIED.
//   Scene node (base ctor 0x006FD710, vtable 0x00FF9D00, refcounted: +4 count with lock xadd, vfunc +0 AddRef, +4 Release,
//   +8 deleting destructor): +0x18 / +0x1C its pending link {next, prev}: 0 = not queued (a drain processed it), self-loop =
//   not queued (constructor, RemoveNode), else linked in a list. +0x30 its owner (the holder). VERIFIED.
//   Queueing (no lock anywhere):
//     0x006FAC70 MarkDirty, 0x006FCA20 (children), 0x006FCB10 (LOD band), 0x006FD9F0 SetOwner: `if (link.next == 0) { link =
//                self-loop; if (owner) 0x006E42E0(owner, node); }` (push_back at the tail). Every push needs owner != 0. VERIFIED.
//     0x006E6480 AddNode(node, group): returns at once when node->owner != 0; else takes a slot, AddRef, SetOwner(holder),
//                then at 0x006E64EF pushes the link again when it is non-zero WITHOUT unlinking it. VERIFIED.
//   Unlinking / freeing:
//     0x006E4920 RemoveNode: only when node->owner == this; clears the slot, unlinks the link if non-zero and self-loops it
//                (0x006E4984), out of the spatial tree, SetOwner(0,0,0), Release. VERIFIED.
//     0x006E4DE0 holder teardown (only caller 0x006E97F0, which frees the holder right after): destroys the spatial tree,
//                then SetOwner(0,0,0) + Release on every slot WITHOUT unlinking; the list dies with the holder, and a node
//                that survives keeps a stale link into freed memory (AddNode later overwrites it). VERIFIED.
//     0x006FD930 node base destructor: detaches its children (0x006FC860), leaves its spatial cell (0x00706200), owner = 0,
//                unlinks +0x20 (its parent's child list), never touches +0x18. The base vtable 0x00FF9D00 is written only by
//                the base ctor and this destructor, so every derived destructor ends in it (23 call / tail-jmp sites). It
//                ends by storing vtable 0x00FA1B78 (the destroyed-node vtable the development checks look for). VERIFIED.
//   So in the game a node linked in a LIVE holder's list is always owned by it and held by its slot (AddRef in AddNode,
//   Release only by RemoveNode after the unlink, or by the teardown whose list dies too): it is never freed while linked,
//   whatever the time it waits (the guarantee is structural, not "drained within the frame"). VERIFIED for the direct paths;
//   INFERRED that no other code calls SetOwner(0) (vfunc +0x1C) on a linked node or releases the holder's reference (the
//   indirect vfunc +0x1C calls with three zero arguments were searched: RemoveNode, the teardown and one non-scene class).
//   0x006E4130 the drain, thiscall(holder), ret (0xD1 bytes, checked byte for byte at Start):
//     splices the whole list into a local sentinel on its stack and empties the holder's list; [this+0x18] = 0; then
//     while the local list is not empty: l = local.prev (the most recently queued first; re-read every iteration); unlink it;
//     l->prev = l->next = 0; node = l - 0x18; node->vfunc+0x48(); bounds = 0x006FB4B0(node, &aligned32); 0x006FAD70(node,
//     bounds) (a no-op when owner == 0: its only caller is the drain); [this+0x18] += 1. Nodes queued during the loop go to
//     the holder's (now empty) list: processed by the next drain. VERIFIED.
//   Callers (all direct): 0x006EBC49 Scene::BeginFrame (every frame), 0x006DF9B5, 0x006EDBC7 (a scene query: drains first
//   so its answer is current), 0x006EF07D, 0x006F226B (render-to-texture, when asked), 0x006F3CF1. Only the BeginFrame CALL
//   is redirected; the other five still drain everything, including what this feature left queued, exactly as they drain
//   what the game queued after BeginFrame (the list is always well formed when Apex returns). VERIFIED.
//   Threads: the list has no lock in any of the functions above, so the game must touch it from one thread (the render
//   thread, which runs BeginFrame). INFERRED. Release is atomic (lock xadd), so a node's destructor may run on any thread.
//
// ---- The copy with a budget (BudgetedDrain) ----
//   Exactly the loop above (same list operations in the same order, same calls, same counter), plus a stop test before
//   each node: at least kMinNodes, then stop at nodesPerFrame nodes or msPerFrame ms. The nodes not reached stay linked,
//   in their order, and the remainder is spliced back at the TAIL of the holder's list (where the drain takes from), so they
//   are processed first next frame and stay queued exactly as the game would have them: RemoveNode unlinks them, MarkDirty
//   sees them as queued, any other drain processes them.
//   The rule: camera still -> the game's drain; camera moving -> the budgeted copy; once a node waited maxDeferMs the budget
//   grows every frame (x2, x4 ... x64, doubling every kGrowStepMs) instead of the whole backlog at once (05/10: the forced full
//   drain was a single long frame in the middle of a camera move); a node waited kHardFactor x maxDeferMs -> the game's drain
//   (so the backlog cannot grow without end while the camera keeps moving).
//
// ---- The node lifetime guard (the registry and three entry hooks) ----
//   Every node the budgeted copy leaves queued is recorded (link -> holder). Invariant kept for recorded nodes: when the
//   link is neither 0 nor a self-loop it is in a LIVE list (the holder's, or a drain's local list on the stack while that
//   drain runs). It holds because a recorded node can only be queued into its owner's list, the owner changes only through
//   AddNode (hook below forgets the record) or the teardown (hook below forgets the holder's records), and drains leave
//   links at 0. With it:
//     - Hook_NodeDtor (0x006FD930, any thread): a recorded node that is still linked is unlinked (neighbours checked to
//       point back at it) and self-looped before the game destroys it; the record is dropped. Expected never to unlink.
//     - Hook_AddNode (0x006E6480): a recorded node with owner 0 that is still linked is unlinked first (the game would push
//       it again over a live link and corrupt the list); the record is dropped. Expected never to unlink.
//     - Hook_HolderTeardown (0x006E4DE0): the holder's records are dropped before its nodes are released (their links then
//       point into a list that dies: the game leaves them, so must Apex).
//   Records are replaced after every budgeted drain (the nodes left now) and dropped after every game drain through the
//   hook; they are kept while a drain runs, so a recorded node destroyed during a drain is unlinked from that drain's local
//   list, which the drain re-reads every iteration. The registry is guarded by an SRW lock never held across game calls.
//   Development build checks (on failure: logged once, budgeting stops until the game restarts, the game's drain runs):
//     before each node of the budgeted copy: its neighbours point back at it and its vtable is inside TS3W.exe .rdata, is not
//     the destroyed-node vtable and its +0x48 slot is inside .text; before each budgeted drain: the same for every recorded
//     node still linked. A node found destroyed (destroyed-node vtable) but still well linked is taken out by writing only
//     its neighbours, never called, counted as "repaired" and logged once, without stopping.
//   After Stop the nodes left are processed by the next BeginFrame (the game's drain): the same exposure as any node the
//   game queues after BeginFrame.
