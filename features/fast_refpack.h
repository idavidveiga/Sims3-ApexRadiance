// Faster cache compression (Apex Radiance, feature "FastCacheCompression"; docs/features/performance.md).
//
// The game compresses resources it keeps in memory databases and writes to packages (the Sim / object compositor caches,
// terrain caches, saves) with a RefPack stream (write 0x004EC200 on Steam 1.67.2, stream vtable slot 0x00FB901C). Its
// compressor allocates 768 KB, clears a 256 KB table and compares EVERY earlier position with the same 3-byte hash inside
// a 16 or 128 KB window: 20-30% of the measured 50 ms+ hitches were dominated by it. This feature answers the stream
// write with features/refpack_codec.h's compressor: the same stream format (header, window, opcodes; any RefPack decoder
// reads it), a bounded hash-chain search with lazy matching, and reusable work memory (a pool of 4 x 512 KB, allocated
// on first use, never freed). Output bytes differ from the game's; the decompressed data is identical.
//
// Since 30/09: a counting run keeps its stream (per thread, with the source's CRC-32C) and its write copies it instead
// of compressing again; streams over 128 KB use the segmented compressor, their pieces parsed on a small pool of worker
// threads (same bytes whoever parses them; docs/features/performance.md).
// Hook: the vtable slot through framework/slot_chain.h (the Frame Profiler's "RefPack compress" counter is the outer
// layer). Calls without a destination: the size bound (flags & 1) passes through; a counting run (the package writer
// measures a stream before allocating it) is answered by the same compressor that then writes it (per thread, matched by
// source and size; the fast write reuses the counting run's flags and depth, so it has exactly the counted size), so a
// buffer sized by one compressor is never written by the other. A stream that does not fit the caller's capacity
// returns -1 (the callers then store the data uncompressed).
// Checks: the first 16 streams of each session (both builds) and, in the development build, 1 stream in 8 by default are
// decompressed with the game's own decoder (0x004EB3B0) and compared with the source; a difference is logged, the game's
// compressor writes that stream instead (when the destination can hold it; else -1), and the feature turns itself off.
