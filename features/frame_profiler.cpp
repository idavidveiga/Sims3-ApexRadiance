// Included in the unified binary; runtime developer mode gates activation.
// Frame-hitch profiler (see frame_profiler.h).
//
// ---- Frames ----
// Frame boundary = the first D3D9 registry Present hook. It is registered at priority -1000 (Priority is an int enum and the
// registry sorts by its value), so it runs before every module's Priority::First Present hook, in particular before
// PostScene resets the camera matrix it captured this frame. Frame time = time between two boundaries.
// Clock: RDTSC when the CPU reports an invariant TSC (calibrated against QPC over 20 ms when first enabled and refined from
// a long QPC baseline while running), otherwise QPC. RDTSC keeps the per-draw cost at a few ns.
//
// ---- Timed game functions (Steam 1.67.2, TS3W.exe, no ASLR) ----
// Every pattern was checked against re\TS3W.exe: unique in .text and matching at the Steam address; for Detours targets
// the first instructions it relocates were decoded by hand and no branch in .text lands inside them. On Steam the pattern
// must match at the Steam address (call sites: and the CALL must reach the Steam callee); on other builds it must match
// exactly once in .text. A target whose bytes do not match (another module detoured or patched it, other build) is
// skipped and listed in Advanced > Hooks. Everything is attached at the first frame boundary after the profiler is
// turned on (on the render thread, after the startup patches) and removed when it is turned off.

//   0x00ABFAC0 Lot::UpdateObjectSceneNode __thiscall(3), ret 0xC (same pattern as LotStreamingOptimizations). Optional and
//              session-only (see "Not hooked by default" below).
// Not hooked on purpose:
//   - 0x006A3EC0 (room lightmap solve): LotEdgeLighting checks its entry bytes before installing and would refuse to
//     install while it is detoured; it is timed through its only caller 0x006A80E0 instead.
//   - Lot::AddLotObjectsToScene (0xAC1130): the Lot Streaming throttle overwrites its entry with a JMP.
//   - 0x00ABFAC0 by default: LotStreamingOptimizations finds it by a pattern that starts at the entry each time it
//     installs; while detoured that fails and the object throttle stays off. Opt-in, not saved, for measurements.
//   - WorldManager::Update (0xC6D570): detoured by LotStreamingOptimizations' map view blocker.
//   - The entries of 0xAEA680 / 0xC845C0: see above. Side effect of the terrain call-site redirect: Smooth Streaming, if
//     it installs while the profiler is on, sees another target at 0xC6D68F and skips the flush of its terrain queue
//     when it is later turned off (its own check, not fatal). Turn the profiler on after Smooth Streaming to avoid it.
//   - On non-Steam builds, GC Scheduler finds 0xC6C290 by a pattern from the entry; while the profiler is on it falls back
//     to its second camera source.
//
// ---- Attribution ----
// Every timed call pushes a frame on a per-thread stack; on return, the call's inclusive time is added to its parent's
// child time. Per category the profiler records:
//   - exclusive (self) time: the call's time minus the time of every timed call inside it. Exclusive times never overlap,
//     so on the render thread they add up to at most the frame time ("Unattributed" = the rest);
//   - inclusive time: counted only for the outermost call of that category on the stack (no double counting under
//     recursion); it includes nested timed calls (e.g. "Lot load stages" inclusive contains the room lighting inside it).
// Time is accumulated per thread (lock-free, owner-written relaxed atomics) and read at each frame boundary as deltas,
// bucketed by thread: render thread (the one calling Present), simulation thread (the one calling GC_try_to_collect)
// and other threads. Calls still open on the render thread are split at the boundary, so the render thread's time goes to
// the frame in which it was spent. Other threads' calls are attributed to the frame in which they return.
// Special splits on the render thread: 0x611680 counts as "EndScene + overlays" until the Present boundary and as
// "Present (driver)" after it; the part of 0x00EC9F00 after 0x611680 returns is "Frame limiter". So a frame interval
// holds the previous Present's wait, the limiter, the game's update and render and this frame's EndScene.
// CPU time = frame time - Present (driver) - Frame limiter.
//
// ---- D3D9 (through the D3D9Hooks registry only) ----
// Present: the start hook at priority -1000 and the end hook at +1000 bracket every other module's Present hooks ("Present
// hooks (mod)"), and every Present hook is timed by name while the profiler is on ("<name> (Present)").
// Every other chain (2026-09-29): the registry itself books its outermost dispatch on a thread as "D3D hooks (mod)"
// (BeginModTime / EndModTime around the whole chain, framework/d3d9_hooks.cpp), also when a module returns Skip / Block.
// Until then only the draws were bracketed by -1000 / +1000 hooks, and a dispatch cut short by Skip (every draw Night
// Lighting replaces) was dropped, so "mod D3D" undercounted about 5x (research\perf2\apexcost\report.md). A replaced
// draw's re-issue, and its driver call, happen inside the outer dispatch and are counted with it. The measurement
// includes the bookkeeping (two clock reads and a push / pop per outermost dispatch).
// Counts: DrawIndexedPrimitive / DrawPrimitive (game draws vs draws inside EndScene: overlays, Picture pass), primitives
// (a -1000 counting hook), CreateTexture / CreateRenderTarget / CreateVertexShader / CreatePixelShader, and SetTexture /
// Set*Shader / Set*ShaderConstantF / SetRenderTarget (counted in the registry's detours, D3D9Hooks::ReadStateCallCounts;
// shown with "Count state calls").
// The registry only calls hooks before the device method, so the duration of resource creation cannot be measured
// through it. Not exposed by the registry at all: CreateVertexBuffer / CreateIndexBuffer, Lock / Unlock, SetRenderState;
// DrawPrimitiveUP / DrawIndexedPrimitiveUP only through ExtraHooks' single observer slot, which Frame Capture owns, so not
// used. Per-hook-name timing of the draw hooks: Advanced > "Per-hook registry timing" (frame_profiler.h).
//
// ---- Main loop, services, jobs, waits, I/O (engine study, Steam 1.67.2; same verification as above) ----
// The render thread is the main thread; its loop (0xECA960) runs app state 0xEC6C30, ServiceManager::Update 0x588E00 ->
// 0x59ED20 (every service's vtable +0x1C update), SceneCaptureManager 0x9DE140, Scene::BeginFrame 0x6EBB70, the render
// frame 0xEC9F00, Scene::EndFrame 0x6E8810 and the clock tick 0x5943F0.
//   0x0059ED20 / 0x0059ED70  ServiceManager main / simulation loops (thiscall(float,float), ret 8): replaced by an
//              identical C++ walk (the pattern is the whole 0x44-byte body) that times each service call, keyed by the
//              update function (names from the study for the known ones, else address + vtable).
//   0x00599720 ExecuteJob (thiscall(job), ret 4): every thread; on the render thread keyed by [job+0x10], or for remote
//              calls (job function 0x7D9840, bytes checked) by the method: vtable+0x10 of [job+0x14], or [obj+0x10] for
//              PostRemoteMethodCall objects (vtable 0x10650C4, checked at 0xABEA0A).
//   0x0059A220 WaitForJob (thiscall(job), ret 4): render thread, keyed by the job waited for.
//   0x004E16F0 Mutex::Lock, 0x004E2760 Semaphore::Wait (thiscall(timeout*), ret 4): every thread pays two clock reads;
//              render-thread calls that blocked > 0.1 ms are booked (as a leaf under the running timed call), keyed by the
//              caller's return address. Semaphore waits inside WaitForJob count as the job wait.
//   0x004DB850 FileStream::Read (ret 8), 0x004DB8E0 Flush (ret), 0x004EC010 RefPack read (stdcall(5), ret 0x14):
//              timed on the render thread; bytes read counted.
//   0x006EBB70 / 0x006E8810 / 0x009DE140 / 0x00EC6C30 / 0x005943F0 / 0x00AD97E0: timed (see kCats).
// The functions many threads call (the loops, ExecuteJob, WaitForJob, Mutex, Semaphore, file I/O) are not attached with
// Detours but by hand with all other threads suspended and checked (see AttachSafe).
// Mutex::Lock is timed only with the Advanced option "Time the Mutex::Lock hook" (off by default since 2026-09-28): the
// resource lookup below calls it ~580 times per scan, so its two clock reads distorted exactly the path being measured.
//
// ---- Counters (anti-stutter plan, research\perf2\plan.md section 8; addresses in framework/game_addresses.h) ----
// Six categories timed on every thread they run on, each with per-frame calls / inclusive ms per thread bucket, the
// longest single call (render thread / other threads) and an extra count. Verified in engine_map\full.asm (Steam 1.67.2):
//   0x004AFFC0 ResourceMgr::FindProvider  thiscall(key*, cookie*), ret 8; push ecx/ebx/ebp/esi/edi, key = [esp+18h],
//              cookie out = [esp+20h] after the pushes; returns the provider (0 = not found). No direct CALL: only virtual,
//              through slot +0x40 of the base vtable 0x00FB2DA0 and of the derived one 0x00FFE250 (0x00FB2DE0 / 0x00FFE290),
//              and the wrapper 0x004AFDA0 (slot +0x44). Hooked by swapping both slots (one aligned 4-byte store each, no code
//              byte changes). Extra: packages probed = index of the returned provider in [this+0x30, this+0x34) (8-byte
//              entries) + 1, or all of them on a miss; misses.
//   0x006E4130 scene pending-node drain    thiscall(), ret; splices the list [this+0x20] out, zeroes [this+0x18] and adds
//              1 per node processed (0x006E41EF), so [this+0x18] read right after the call = nodes processed. Timed at Scene::BeginFrame's CALL 0x006EBC49 only (the other 5
//              callers are not per-frame). Extra: nodes. Since 2026-09-29 the CALL is shared through framework/call_chain.h:
//              the profiler is the outer layer, the scene node budget (features/scene_budget.h) the inner one when on;
//              extra "deferred" = nodes the budget left queued for the next frames (SceneBudget::TakeDrainNote).
//   0x004EC200 RefPack stream write        thiscall(src, size, dst, capacity, flags), ret 0x14 (uses [ecx+4] = allocator;
//              the plan's "stdcall" was wrong). dst == 0 with flags & 1 = size bound only (no work, not timed). Else
//              FUN_004EC0A0 -> FUN_004EB750 (<= 16 KB) or FUN_004EBB90; returns the compressed size. Only referenced by the
//              stream vtable slot 0x00FB901C; FUN_004EC0A0 / 004EBB90 / 004EB750 have no other callers. Hooked through that
//              slot as the outer layer of framework/slot_chain.h (site RefPackCompress; the fast compressor of
//              features/fast_refpack.h is the inner layer when on). Extra: bytes in (size), bytes out (return value).
//   0x006152F0 / 0x006154B0 DXT1 / DXT5 encoders  cdecl(dst*, src*) (callers "add esp,8"); dst = {ptr, width +4, height
//              +8, pitch +0xC}. 8 + 7 direct callers on several threads: since 2026-09-29 hooked at the entry through
//              framework/entry_chain.h (the prologue 55 8B EC 83 E4 F0 moved to a trampoline, a JMP written with all other
//              threads suspended), the profiler being the outer layer and the fast encoder (features/fast_dxt.h) the inner
//              one. Extra: pixels (width x height).
//   0x00C62D40 object lookup by ID         thiscall(idLo, idHi, int* visited), ret 0xC; ecx passed on to FUN_00C60D30. 233
//              call sites (script natives on the simulation thread, lot lighting, camera). Since 2026-09-29 hooked at the
//              entry through framework/entry_chain.h (site ObjectById: the 8 prologue bytes 8B 44 24 0C 8B 54 24 08 moved to a
//              trampoline, a JMP written with all other threads suspended), the profiler being the outer layer and the object
//              lookup index (features/object_index.h) the inner one. Extra: "from index" (ObjectIndex::TakeLookupNote).
//   0x006A8BA0 lot room solve              thiscall(timer*, float budget), ret 8; x87 stack empty at the call and on return.
//              Its only caller is the lot lighting update FUN_00ADB8F0 (render thread): timed at that CALL, 0x00ADB9AD.
//              ecx = one level object of the lot (the deque at manager+0x24..0x40), so calls = lot levels updated (not rooms).
//   0x0068B810 wall AO step                thiscall(stopwatch*, float budget), ret 8; only reference: slot +0x1C of the solver
//              vtable 0x00FF0594 (0x00FF05B0), called by the solver driver 0x00688920 from the room solve above. One call =
//              one pass over every outdoor wall of a level (no time check). Hooked through that slot as a layer of
//              framework/slot_chain.h inside the wall shading gate (features/lot_lighting_motion.h, Layer::Gate, which must
//              be outermost), so with the gate on only the passes that run are timed. Extra: none (calls = passes).
//   0x004B1AE0 / 0x00736660 ResourceMgr / ResourceSystem::GetKeyList  thiscall(vector* out, filter*, bool unique), ret 0xC;
//              only references: slot +0x20 of the base (0x00FB2DC0) and derived (0x00FFE270) vtables; the derived one calls
//              the base directly (no double count). Outer layer of both slots; the file list cache (features/resource_cache.h)
//              is inside. Extras: keys (the out vector's growth in 16-byte keys, before the derived sort / unique), packages
//              answered from the file list cache (kXListCached).
//   The FindProvider slots are shared with the resource lookup cache through framework/slot_chain.h (the profiler is the
//   outer layer whichever installs first); Hook_FindProvider calls SlotChain::Next and adds "from cache" (kXCacheHits)
//   and "absent from cache" (kXCacheAbsent, "Remember missing files").
// No branch in .text lands inside any replaced prologue or CALL (checked in full.asm). S3SS and the other installed ASIs
// touch none of these sites (plan section 6). They are attached only once the game-address scan has run
// (GameAddr::Scanned, first Present + 1 s), on every build, so the scan's self-check never sees these hooks; the two CALLs
// are written with every other thread suspended (WriteCallSuspended), the lot lighting update being also reachable from
// the lot impostor builder path.
//
// ---- Sampling (Advanced, off by default) ----
// For the time no timed function covers ("Unattributed"): a sampler thread pauses the render and/or simulation thread
// g_sampleHz times a second (default 2000; high-resolution waitable timer), records EIP and the TS3W return addresses
// found on the first 4 KB of its stack, and the render thread assigns the samples to frame intervals. Per hitch:
// share of samples per code class (TS3W, DXVK/driver, system, Apex, other ASI, other), the top 8 code locations (TS3W
// function start guessed from the int3 padding, or the module), the top 8 TS3W call sites on the stack and the TS3W
// callers of samples in system code (waits, heap, I/O). Session tables compare hitch frames with other frames.
// Cost: each sample pauses the target for the SuspendThread / GetThreadContext / 4 KB copy / ResumeThread round trip
// (typically 5-30 us under WOW64, measured and shown in the UI), i.e. roughly 1-6% of the sampled thread at 2000 Hz, plus
// the same order of CPU on the sampler's core. The render thread's per-frame work is a table update per sample.
//
// ---- Output ----
// Render thread: rings (graph, averages, median window, the last 200 hitches), histogram for percentiles, totals.
// Hitches go to a single-producer / single-consumer queue; a writer thread appends them to ApexRadiance_Hitches.txt at most
// once per second (and on "Save report now"). Nothing is written or flushed on the render thread.
