// Scene node budget (Apex Radiance, feature "SceneNodeBudget", menu "Spread new objects over frames"; experimental, off by
// default; docs/features/performance.md, section "How it works: Spread New Objects Over Frames (C6)").
//
// Every frame Scene::BeginFrame (0x006EBB70 on Steam 1.67.2) calls the pending-node drain 0x006E4130 on its scene
// sub-object: every scene node that was added, moved or re-bounded since the last frame (queued on the intrusive list at
// holder+0x20 through the node's link at +0x18) gets its update (node vfunc +0x48), its world bounds (0x006FB4B0) and its
// move in the spatial tree (0x006FAD70). There is no limit: a lot that streams in queues thousands of nodes at once
// (measured once: 2224 nodes, 2.84 ms in one frame).
// While the camera moves this feature answers that one CALL (0x006EBC49) with an exact copy of the game's loop that stops
// after `nodesPerFrame` nodes or `msPerFrame` ms; the rest goes back to the tail of the scene's own list and is processed
// first the next frames. When the camera is still, when nothing was left, or when the oldest waiting node waited
// `maxDeferMs`, the game's own drain runs (all nodes). Effect: an object can appear, or finish moving in the culling tree,
// one or a few frames later while the camera moves; nothing is skipped.
//
// Node lifetime (the reason it was suspended in v1.8.0, fixed 2026-09-29): the game never frees a node that is linked in a
// live holder's list (the holder holds a reference; RemoveNode unlinks before releasing), but its destructor and AddNode do
// not unlink. So every node this feature leaves queued is recorded, and three entry hooks keep the guarantee for them even
// if some unknown path broke it: the node destructor 0x006FD930 unlinks a recorded node that is still linked, AddNode
// 0x006E6480 unlinks a recorded, ownerless, still linked node before it pushes it again, and the holder teardown 0x006E4DE0
// forgets the holder's records before its list dies. Details in scene_budget.cpp.
//
// Hooks: framework/call_chain.h (site SceneDrain, layer SceneBudget; the Frame Profiler's "Scene pending nodes" counter is
// the outer layer) and framework/entry_chain.h (sites SceneNodeDtor, SceneAddNode, SceneHolderTeardown, layer SceneBudget).
// The drain runs on the render thread (the game's drain has no lock); the destructor hook may run on any thread.
