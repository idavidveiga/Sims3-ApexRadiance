// Lot lighting while the camera moves (Apex Radiance, feature "LotLightingMotion"; docs/features/performance.md).
//
// Every frame each lot with lighting work runs the lot lighting update (0x00ADB8F0 on Steam 1.67.2), which asks
// 0x00ADB120 for its time budget (ms, returned in ST0: 5 for an ordinary lot, 10 while it loads, 15 for a "priority"
// lot, 30 while that one loads, 1000 in the world tool mode) and relights its levels' rooms until the budget is spent
// (the room solve resumes where it stopped on the next frame). While the camera moves the current lot's 15 ms made the
// medium hitches. This feature redirects the only CALL of 0x00ADB120 (0x00ADB95D) to a wrapper that, while the camera
// moves, scales the game's budget so the priority lot gets `budgetMs` (default 3) and every other lot the same fraction
// of its own budget (5 -> 1 ms at 3 ms): the engine's own order and priorities stay, only the time per frame shrinks.
// The world tool mode's 1000 ms is left alone. When the camera stops (300 ms without motion) the game's budgets return.
// Camera motion: the camera eye ([[root]+0x24]+0x60, the same read WorldManager::Update does at 0x00C6D5C9), sampled at
// each budget call and once per frame (Present) while this feature or the wall shading gate below is on.

// ---- Wall shading while moving (feature "WallShadingWhileMoving"; docs/features/performance.md) ----
// Each lot level has a wall ambient-occlusion solver (level+0x290, vtable 0x00FF0594 on Steam 1.67.2) whose step
// 0x0068B810 (reached only through the slot 0x00FF05B0) shades every outdoor wall of the level in one go, with no time
// check: 10-17 ms per pass, and several passes in one frame when lots load (54-108 ms). The step is called by the solver
// driver 0x00688920 (slot +0xC), which stores the step's return value as the solver state (0 first pass due, 1 refinement
// due, 2 done) and calls it again next frame while the state is not 2. Returning the current state is therefore "not
// done, try later", which the step itself does in state 1 when its cost estimate is negative. This gate swaps the slot
// (framework/slot_chain.h) and, for calls from that driver with a per-frame budget (< 100 ms: the synchronous solve's
// 60 s and the tool mode's 1000 ms are never touched):
//   - while the camera moves: defers the first pass (state 0) and the refinement (state 1) until it stops, each for at most
//     `firstPassWaitMs` (2 s) in a row: the lot's load finishes only after the first pass of all its levels (0x00ADBBA0 at
//     load stage 20), and a lot thumbnail (ThumbnailManager, 0x00AE06B0 -> 0x00ADBC30) only after every refinement;
//   - always: at most one pass that takes >= 1 ms per frame across all lots (a frame = between two Presents, or 33 ms).
// The gate is the outermost layer of the slot (SlotChain::Layer::Gate): it needs its own return address to recognise the
// driver, and the Frame Profiler's "Wall AO pass" counter (inner layer) then times only the passes that run.
