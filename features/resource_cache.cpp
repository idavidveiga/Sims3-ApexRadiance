//              instance ^ 0x08000000). About 36% of all lookups are such misses (research\perf2\round3.md section 3).
//   The list (the only writers of [this+0x30..0x38]; its vector helpers 0x004B1F50 / 0x004B25B0 / 0x004B0B90 have no

//              override (slot +0x34 of the derived vtable, same arguments), which calls 0x004B2D00 directly.
//   0x004B2EC0 SetDatabasePriority thiscall(db*, int priority), ret 8, slot +0x3C of both: erase + sorted re-insert.
//   Destructors 0x004B35A0 / 0x007366A0 (-> 0x004B30B0): the list goes with the manager (game exit).
//   0x004B0960 DatabaseChanged thiscall(db*, keyVector*), ret 8, slot +0x4C of both: the engine's own notification that
//              keys of a package changed (it runs FindProvider for each key and tells the resource cache's listeners).
//              Sent by the ResourceSystem's file watcher when a package file changed on disk (0x00734D10: the package's
//              outer object +0xC "file changed?" then GetKeyList, then mgr+0x4C at 0x00734DBF) and by the loose-file
//              folder databases' directory watcher after a rescan (0x004A4160, AFTER the folder's key set changed).
//   Package classes (every IDatabase implementation: the constructors that store the interface base 0x00FB21F8 are
//   0x004A550C DDF, 0x004A8F7C DPF, 0x0072B8FB MemoryDB, 0x0072CC6B packed stream, 0x0098B160 ContentManager):

//              outer+8; registered by the ResourceSystem's path registration 0x00737950 for Resource.cfg packages, i.e. the
//              game's and the mods' .package files). OpenRecord 0x007345D0: with no record / info asked and a key set
//              present ([this+0xB0], built from the index by the idle close 0x00735320 before it closes the file) it only
//              probes that set; otherwise it opens the file (slot +0x50, which drops the key set on success), and asks
//              the index through the base OpenRecord 0x0072D470, which accepts only the open-existing dispositions 6 and 3
//              (it can never create a record) and needs the open mode [this+0x14]. DeleteRecord (slot +0x40, 0x007346A0)
//              calls 0x00624F70 = "return false". So its key set is the file's index: it changes only when the file on
//              disk changes, which the watcher reports through DatabaseChanged (0x00734D10 above). One exception: when the
//              key set is absent and the file cannot be opened at that moment, the probe answers "no" for every key (open
//              failure, nothing changes in memory). After a lookup such a package is closed with no key set ([+0xB0] == 0
//              and [+0x14] == 0): answers that relied on its "no" are not stored (RoReliable).
//   Other classes: 0x00FB2600 DPF (writable package; derived 0x01048DA0), 0x00FB2420 DDF (loose-file folders: Mods/Files,
//              NonPackaged/Ini, UI/Layouts), 0x00FFD790 base packed stream (e.g. the CAS compositor cache at -1000),
//              0x00FFD5F8 MemoryDB, 0x01046EE8 ContentManager (downloaded content: it forwards to sub-databases). All are
//              "can gain keys at any time": probed on every answer, unless their writes are counted (write epochs below).
//
// ---- The lookup cache ----
//   Key = (manager, 16-byte resource key). Value = {package (0 = no package holds it), priority, its index in the list,
//   insert tick, write-epoch sum}. Validity:
//     - g_gen: bumped before and after every RegisterDatabase / SetDatabasePriority / DatabaseChanged (hooked through
//       their vtable slots); g_mutating > 0 while one runs: lookups then go straight to the game and nothing is stored.
//       Entries carry a table stamp tied to the generation they were stored under (a new generation = an empty table,
//       without clearing memory).
//     - a snapshot per (manager, generation): list begin / size / fingerprint and the packages that are not of the
//       read-only class (index, pointer, whether their writes are counted). A list that changed without the hooks noticing
//       (begin / size / fingerprint differ under the same generation) bumps the generation and is logged.
//     - on a lookup: the entry at the stored index still holds {package, priority}; the package still holds the key (one
//       OpenRecord probe, exactly as the game asks); none of the non-read-only packages above it holds the key (one probe
//       each; answers with more than 32 such packages above them are not stored); the generation did not move meanwhile;
//       the entry is younger than 60 s. Any failure: the game's own lookup runs (and its answer is stored again).
//     - storing: only when no list change happened around the game's lookup and every read-only package above the answer
//       (all of them for "absent") could answer for sure (key set present or file open, checked after the lookup).
//   "Remember missing files" adds:
//     - absent entries (package 0, "above" = every non-read-only package): re-checked by probing those packages; the game
//       leaves *priorityOut alone on a miss, so does the cache.
//     - write epochs. Hooks on every traced write path of the DPF (both vtables), DDF and base packed stream classes
//       (EpochSpec below; research by reading every writer of their key structures) call WriteBegin / WriteEnd around the
//       call: a per-database counter (1024 buckets by pointer; a shared bucket only costs extra re-checks), a global
//       sequence and a global "writes in progress" count. An entry stores the sum of the counters of its counted
//       databases (the non-read-only ones above it and its own package when not read-only), taken while no write was in
//       progress and none happened since before the game's lookup (seqlock). A later answer whose sum is unchanged
//       (sequence stable, no write in progress) needs no probe of those databases, nor of a read-only answering package
//       (same premise as above); uncounted classes are still probed. A changed sum: every package is probed as before and,
//       when that passes with no write meanwhile, the sum is refreshed.
//   Nothing of Apex is held (no lock) while game code runs. 32-bit counters (relaxed atomics).
//
// ---- Write paths counted (the probe is OpenRecord(key, 0, 1, 6, 1, 0); V = read in full.asm) ----
//   DPF 0x00FB2600 / 0x01048DA0 (the derived class overrides only +0x7C / +0x84): the probe reads the hash index

//     and re-inserts the same key under the mutex: no visible change.

//   Packed stream 0x00FFD790 (not the read-only class, whose vtable is 0x00FFE078): the probe needs the open mode

//   0x01046EE8 (answers depend on sub-databases changed by non-virtual install code), and any other class.
//   Every function's first bytes are checked against the studied ones before its class is counted; a class with any
//   difference, or whose slots do not hold what Apex expects, stays probed (all or nothing per class).
//
// ---- The file list cache ----
//   0x004B1AE0 ResourceMgr::GetKeyList thiscall(vector* out, filter*, bool unique), ret 0xC (slot +0x20 of the base
//              vtable). unique = false: for each {db, priority} of [this+0x30, this+0x34) (read once, no lock) count +=
//              db->vfunc+0x30(out, filter); returns count. The databases append matching keys to out (inline append when
//              end < capacity, else the vector insert 0x006D3810, or resize 0x0045A5A0 then fill) and return how many.
//   0x00736660 ResourceSystem's override (slot +0x20 of the derived vtable): calls 0x004B1AE0 directly, then, when the
//              count and out are not 0, returns 0x004AFCD0(out) (cdecl: sort + unique of the whole vector, returns its size).
//   The type filter {vtable 0x00FD8248, type}: its only virtual used by the databases is +4 = 0x005949F0, "key[2] (type)
//   == this+4". CAS LoadBlendGeometryCallback 0x005DA0C0 asks it for type 0x0A037DDA with unique = false (then sorts and
//   uniques itself); every read-only package walks its whole index (0x004AC9C0) or key set (0x0072DE50) for it.
//   The cache answers only unique = false with that filter class: it runs the same loop itself; for a read-only package
//   whose keys of that type were captured under the current generation it appends them (same package order, same keys;
//   the order inside one package can differ, as it does in the game between the key-set walk and the index walk), every
//   other package is asked for real. A read-only package's list is captured from out after the real call, and stored
//   only when it could answer for sure (key set present or file open before and after).
