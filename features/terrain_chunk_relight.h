// Local terrain relight (part of Night Lights, driven by patches/night_terrain_relight_patch.cpp): re-renders only the
// terrain chunks a lamp change touches, through the game's own one-chunk-per-terrain-update sweep branch (chunk+0x54),
// one chunk at a time and paced, instead of arming the full rebuild (chunk+0x55 on every chunk: a synchronous bake + DXT
// of every chunk in one frame, ~240 ms, then a duplicate sweep). Also the paced sweep of every chunk (phase 2) that can
// replace Apex's own dusk and lamp-change full rebuilds. See terrain_chunk_relight.cpp and
// docs/features/night-lighting/terrain-relight.md "Local terrain relight".
//
// Render thread only (OnPresent and the game's terrain update, which run on the same thread).
