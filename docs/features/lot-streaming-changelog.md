# Lot Streaming research and refinement changelog

**Branch:** `feature/lot-lod-streaming`  
**Research window:** 2026-10-02 through 2026-10-04  
**Current validated baseline:** Lot LOD distance **300** + Max Active Lots **16**  
**Game build used for the controlled probes:** EA 1.69.47.024017

This document records the Lot Streaming work separately from the general Apex Radiance changelog. It describes what was
measured in the game, which native fields were changed, how the current implementation works, which parts are independent
Apex research, and which parts share lineage with Sims3SettingsSetter (S3SS).

## 1. Goal

The original problem was not simply "increase draw distance". The Sims 3 has several distinct decisions in the lot-detail
pipeline:

- whether a lot is eligible for Detailed View by distance/score;
- how many lots may remain detailed at once;
- how aggressively multiple LoD transitions are allowed to start;
- whether camera motion / viewing angle affects those transitions;
- how a lot's objects are built after the lot is promoted.

The work therefore separated **eligibility**, **capacity**, **transition throttling**, **visibility stability** and
**per-object loading** instead of treating them as one setting.

## 2. Native fields and functions verified

The controlled EA 1.69 probes resolved and exercised the following native path:

| Item | EA 1.69 address / field | Meaning in the current research |
|---|---:|---|
| LotLodScoring | `0x00C6B610` | Native lot scoring path used before Detailed View decisions. |
| Lot metric function | `0x00C62110` | Produces the lot visibility/distance metric observed by the probe. |
| LotLodScoring metric CALL | `0x00C6B957` | Verified single CALL used to bind the metric safely. |
| Camera-bias branch | `0x00C623A5` | Short JZ used by the lot-visibility camera bias. |
| LotDetailRequest | `0x00AC1830` | Promotion/demotion request path logged by the probe. |
| WorldManager global | `0x01246C54` | Live WorldManager pointer. |
| WorldManager + `0xDC` | live field | Lot LOD distance. Native observed baseline: 70. |
| WorldManager + `0xE0` | live field | Active Lot Bias. Observed value: 8.0. |
| WorldManager + `0xE4` | live field | Max Active Lots. Observed/default test baseline: 8. |
| WorldManager + `0xE8` | live field | Terrain-height threshold. Observed value: 600. |
| WorldManager + `0xEC` | live field | Camera speed threshold. Native observed value: 32. |

The probe identifies the lot pointer from the metric's arguments at runtime and refuses to guess when the expected relation
cannot be proven.

## 3. Lot LOD distance: 70 -> 100 -> 200 -> 300

### What was changed

The test probe temporarily overrides only `WorldManager+0xDC`, after first proving the expected baseline. The write is
guarded, maintained only while Apex still owns the value, and restored on a clean unload.

### What the tests proved

The native metric behaves as a squared-distance eligibility test for the controlled cases:

- distance 200 produced a cutoff around **40,000 = 200^2**;
- distance 300 produced a cutoff around **90,000 = 300^2**;
- at 300, a lot with metric **87,798.671875** remained Detailed View ON (~296.31 distance);
- values clearly above 90,000 remained outside the distance eligibility range in the controlled sparse-area test.

OFF states below the cutoff are not evidence of a different distance formula: the independent active-lot capacity and
priority rules can keep an otherwise eligible lot out of Detailed View.

### Current decision

**300 is the current validated Lot LOD distance baseline.** No larger value is being adopted at this stage.

## 4. Max Active Lots: 8 -> 16

### What was changed

A second guarded test override was added for `WorldManager+0xE4`.

This is the native **Max Active Lots** capacity field. It is separate from the S3SS setting named
`Throttle Lot LoD Transitions Max Active Lot Threshold`.

### What the tests proved

With distance 300 and the native capacity still at 8, dense areas repeatedly saturated at eight Detailed View lots.

With only the capacity changed from 8 to 16:

- WorldManager read back **Max Active Lots=16**;
- the same dense reference camera position that had previously saturated at exactly eight lots produced **16 consecutive
  Detailed View ON** lots;
- the 17th and later candidates could remain OFF even while inside distance 300, proving the capacity/priority stage is
  independent of distance eligibility.

### Current decision

**16 is the current validated Max Active Lots baseline.** We are deliberately not testing 24/32 now. The goal is
refinement and stability, not maximising the number indefinitely.

## 5. Memory and stability observation

The 300 + 16 run showed no crash, fatal error or runaway allocation pattern in the recorded test.

During a heavier part of the run:

- private committed memory reached about **1566 MB**;
- roughly **1994-2007 MB** of address space remained free;
- the largest free block remained about **1790 MB**;
- later the private value returned to roughly **1285-1286 MB**.

This is not a universal memory guarantee for every world/save, but it is enough to keep 300 + 16 as the current practical
baseline for further refinement.

## 6. How the current Lot Streaming pieces work

### 6.1 Smooth Lot Streaming

Apex can enable the game's native **Throttle Lot LoD Transitions** mechanism and maintain a camera-speed threshold. It does
not replace the game's lot loader.

The currently implemented Apex production feature uses camera threshold 5.0, while the native value observed by the probe
is 32.0. **5.0 is not considered final by this changelog; it still requires an A/B refinement test with the new 300 + 16
baseline.**

### 6.2 Transition Max Active Lot Threshold = 12

The feature `LotActiveThreshold` resolves the live setting
`Throttle Lot LoD Transitions Max Active Lot Threshold` and currently applies 12.

This value controls the native **transition throttle policy**. It is **not** the same field as
`WorldManager+0xE4 Max Active Lots`.

The value 12 comes from the S3SS LotStreamingOptimizations implementation and still needs to be re-evaluated now that the
actual Detailed View capacity has been validated at 16.

### 6.3 Keep Lot Visibility Stable

The game's metric contains a camera-view bias controlled by a short conditional branch. The S3SS behavior changes the
branch from JZ (`0x74`) to JMP (`0xEB`), so lots are not promoted/demoted purely because the viewing angle changes.

Apex implements the same behavior with its own address resolution, ownership detection and safe restoration rules.

### 6.4 Pause Lot Streaming in Map View

S3SS implements a map-view blocker around the same native `WorldManager+0x258` "skip lot streaming" gate.

Apex shares the feature goal but the standalone implementation is different: it does not detour
`WorldManager::Update`; it maintains the live gate from Apex's existing pump while map view is open and for a short
exit grace period, then restores the previous value safely.

### 6.5 Spread Lot Objects While Loading

This is **not** a Lot LOD distance/capacity setting. It runs later, when a promoted lot builds scene objects.

The feature has direct S3SS lineage and is explicitly a port/adaptation of
`LotStreamingOptimizations.objectThrottle` into Apex's framework:

- intercept `Lot::AddLotObjectsToScene`;
- build regular objects in small continuation windows;
- use the game's remote-method marshal for continuations;
- keep large objects / outdoor flora synchronous in the first window because one-shot lot activation fixups require
  them to exist immediately.

## 7. S3SS provenance: what is shared and what is Apex work

The public S3SS source was compared against the current standalone Apex implementation so the provenance is recorded
explicitly.

| Area | Relationship to S3SS | Current authorship/provenance statement |
|---|---|---|
| Native TS3 Lot LOD metric / fields | Same game code is available to both mods | **EA game code**, not owned by either project. |
| Distance 300 research and cutoff proof | Not part of the current public S3SS LotStreamingOptimizations settings | **Apex research/probe work.** |
| Max Active Lots 8 -> 16 at WorldManager+0xE4 | Distinct from S3SS's threshold 12 | **Apex research/probe work.** |
| Metric argument identification, 200^2/300^2 validation, diagnostic logging | No equivalent used for these controlled tests in the compared S3SS patch | **Apex diagnostic/research work.** |
| Transition throttle + threshold 12 | S3SS implements the same native live settings and uses 12 | **Behavior/value lineage from S3SS; Apex standalone wrapper/resolver/ownership code is its own implementation.** |
| Camera speed threshold 5.0 | S3SS exposes the same setting with default 5.0 | **Behavior/default lineage from S3SS; still under Apex refinement.** |
| Visibility JZ -> JMP | Same patch behavior is present in S3SS | **Behavior/patch lineage from S3SS; Apex adds its own validation/ownership/restoration layer.** |
| Map-view blocker | Same feature goal and native skip gate | **S3SS lineage for the feature; Apex standalone implementation differs and avoids the S3SS WorldManager::Update detour.** |
| Object throttle | S3SS public implementation is the source lineage | **Port/adaptation from S3SS into Apex EntryChain and safety framework.** |

### Does standalone Apex contain S3SS code?

The accurate answer is **not "none at all" and not "the Lot Streaming code is just S3SS"**.

- The standalone Apex framework was rewritten and does not carry wholesale S3SS framework files or S3SS file headers.
- Several Lot Streaming features deliberately reproduce S3SS behavior because S3SS already identified useful native
  controls.
- **Object throttle is explicitly a port/adaptation from the S3SS feature and therefore has direct source lineage.**
- The visibility override and the 12 / 5.0 streaming-setting choices also have direct S3SS behavior lineage, while Apex
  supplies its own integration, validation, ownership and restoration machinery.
- The new **Distance 300**, **Max Active Lots 16**, metric probe, squared-distance validation and the controlled EA 1.69
  tests are Apex-side research and are not presented as S3SS work.

This distinction should be preserved in future public documentation and credits.

## 8. Current validated baseline for the next ASI

The refinement test build created after this changelog keeps:

- Lot LOD distance = **300**;
- Max Active Lots = **16**;
- Active Lot Bias = **8.0** (unchanged);
- Terrain-height threshold = **600** (unchanged);
- the existing state of object spreading / Scene Node Budget unchanged unless the tester explicitly performs a separate
  A/B.

The 300/16 values are still applied through the diagnostic probe so the log can prove the readback and every promotion /
demotion while the remaining transition behavior is refined.

## 9. What remains to refine

The next work is deliberately narrower than the research already completed:

1. **Transition threshold 12:** determine whether 12 remains the best throttle point with a true 16-lot capacity, or
   whether matching it to 16 / another value produces smoother behavior.
2. **Camera threshold 5 vs native 32:** compare transition churn, visual delay and stutter with 300 + 16 held constant.
3. **Visibility override A/B:** determine how much the camera-bias JZ->JMP reduces unnecessary lot churn with the new
   baseline.
4. **Production integration:** once the three items above are resolved, move the validated 300 / 16 behavior out of the
   diagnostic-only path and expose the final user-facing controls in the Performance menu.
5. **Objects/flora distance research:** intentionally deferred; it is a separate scene/LOD problem and is not part of this
   Lot Streaming refinement pass.


## 10. Production integration after validation

After the final controlled OFF vs Smooth comparison, the research baseline was promoted into normal Apex code:

- `WorldManager+0xDC` is now managed by the production **Extended Lot Detail** feature, default **300**.
- `WorldManager+0xE4` is managed by the same feature, default **16**.
- Both settings are persisted in `[patches.LotDetailRange]` and can be changed from the Performance menu.
- The production implementation does **not** install the metric/scoring/detail-request diagnostic hooks.
- Smooth Lot Streaming is validated as the normal companion behavior: native transition throttle ON + camera threshold 5.
- The misleading threshold-12 switch is no longer shown in the main menu. The underlying diagnostic feature was kept for development/reference.
- Lot-object throttling and Scene Node Budget are presented separately under Object streaming.

Final A/B in one game session (300 + 16 held constant):
- everything OFF: 268 transitions over ~107.7 s = **149.3 transitions/min**; 87 same-lot reversals <=5 s; 48 <=2 s.
- Smooth ON: 190 transitions over ~114.9 s = **99.2 transitions/min**; 18 same-lot reversals <=5 s; 3 <=2 s.
- approximate reduction: **34%** transitions/min, **79%** <=5 s reversals, **94%** <=2 s reversals.
