# Faster Scripts

The game's scripts (Sim decisions, routing, timers) run on the Mono interpreter built into `TS3W.exe`. Faster Scripts
removes two pieces of extra work it does constantly: every comparison of two decimal numbers called a separate library
to check each number first, and every look-up of a type's information went through a lock and a search. The results
are the same; scripts simply do less work. Nothing on screen changes.

## Status

| | |
|---|---|
| Availability | Experimental: Released in 2.7.0 |
| Default | On |
| Menu | System > Performance > Game and scripts > *Faster scripts* (Experimental badge) |
| Configuration | `[patches.ScriptMath]` in `ApexRadiance.toml` |
| Source | [`features/script_math.{h,cpp}`](../../../features/script_math.cpp), [`patches/performance_patches.cpp`](../../../patches/performance_patches.cpp) (`ScriptMathPatch`) |

## The problem

- **NaN tests.** The interpreter's 25 floating-point compare and branch handlers test both operands for NaN by calling
  `msvcr80!_isnan` through a register before comparing them: two library calls per comparison.
- **Type objects.** `mono_type_get_object` (0x00EA8A00) takes a lock and searches a hash table for the reflection
  object of a type, on every call, though the answer for a (domain, type) pair never changes while the domain lives.

## How Apex Radiance solves it

The two parts start independently; the switch is on when at least one of them could start.

1. **NaN tests inline.** In each of the 25 handlers, both test blocks become the same test without the call: `fucomip
   st0, st0` (which pops and sets the parity flag only for a NaN) and `jnp`, leaving `eax` 0 or 1 exactly as `_isnan`
   returned it. The registers, the x87 stack and the flags the following jumps read are those of the original.
2. **Type object cache.** `mono_type_get_object` answers from a lock-free (domain, type) cache filled only with the
   game's own answers. `mono_domain_free` (0x00E75340) bumps a generation first, so nothing stored for a freed domain is
   answered again. Answers equal to the class's `reflection_info` (TypeBuilder types) are never stored. The first 256
   answers from the cache are also compared with the game's; a difference turns the cache off for the session.

## Settings

| Menu label | TOML key | Type | Default | Range | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Faster scripts | `[patches.ScriptMath] enabled` | bool | on | | Turns both parts on. A missing key reads as on |

The row is part of the Overview's Performance group switch. It is not in the Performance part of profiles: applying a
profile leaves it as it is.

## Compatibility and interactions

- **Mods that patch the Mono interpreter** (Sims3Performance's isinst cache at 0x00EA3820, its Mono ehash at
  0x00EBBDE0 / 0x00EA8720, MonoPatcher) touch other functions. A handler whose bytes differ from the expected pattern is
  left alone.
- **Game build:** Steam 1.67.2 and the EA app build. The NaN handlers are found by pattern in `.text` on any build; the
  type cache uses the address group `ScriptTypeCache` (signatures of `mono_type_get_object` and `mono_domain_free`).

## Limitations

- The gain depends on how much script work a household runs; it has not been measured in frames.
- If the type cache finds a difference it turns itself off for the session and the game's answer is used (logged).

## Technical reference

**NaN handlers** (0x00E54D1B..0x00E58304 on Steam 1.67.2), each:

```
fld qword [esi-10h]                         DD 46 F0
mov ebx, [_isnan import slot]               8B 1D <slot>       \
sub esi, 10h | 8                            83 EE xx            |
sub esp, 8 ; fstp qword [esp]               83 EC 08 DD 1C 24   | block A (22 bytes)
call ebx ; add esp, 8 ; test eax, eax       FF D3 83 C4 08 85 C0 /
jnz <nan path>                              0F 85 rel32 | 75 rel8
fld qword [esi+8] | [esi]                   DD 46 08 | DD 06
sub esp, 8 ; fstp qword [esp] ; call ebx ; add esp, 8 ; test eax, eax     block B (13 bytes)
```

Both blocks become two pushes for the old `sub esp, 8`, `fucomip st0, st0`, `jnp +1`, `inc eax` (`eax` zeroed first
in A, already 0 in B). The bytes from the old return address on (A +17, B +8) are kept, so a thread inside `_isnan`
during the switch returns into the same code; `ebx` still receives `_isnan`'s address (`mov ebx, imm32`). Start checks
that the slot holds `msvcr80!_isnan` and that it returns exactly 0 or 1, and no branch in `TS3W.exe` targets the inside
of a block. The writes are made with every other thread suspended outside the changed bytes.

**Type cache:** `EntryChain` sites `MonoTypeGetObject` (cdecl(domain, type)) and `MonoDomainFree` (cdecl(domain,
force)), layer `ScriptMath`. Entries are written with a sequence lock and read without a lock.

Log lines: `[ScriptMath] N interpreter compare handlers test NaN inline (...)`, `[ScriptMath] Type objects
(mono_type_get_object ...) answered from a cache; the first 256 answers are checked against the game`, a warning for a
part that could not start, and at Stop a summary of calls, cache answers, checks, differences and domains freed.
