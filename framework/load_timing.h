// Load-phase timing for the log ([LoadTiming], 07/10): logging only, no behaviour change. Hooks and features note events
// with one QueryPerformanceCounter read and an atomic store (no lock, no log line on their thread); the start-up pump thread
// (10 ms) turns them into log lines and takes the counter snapshots of the load window:
//   process start -> game device created -> features started;
//   world load start (the first of: the object map indexed, the world change seen by Night Lighting) -> first world draw
//   (the world terrain drawn, end of the load screen) -> load settled; numbered for every load of the session;
//   during the load window: FastRefPack, FastDxt, ResourceCache / FileListCache, room-light solves, shader precompile waits.
// The save or world name is not logged: no existing hook reads it.
