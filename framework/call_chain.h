// Layered hooks on one CALL instruction (E8 rel32) of the game that several Apex modules wrap (the call-site twin of
// entry_chain.h and slot_chain.h).
//
// The CALL's rel32 points to the outermost installed layer's hook; each layer calls Next(site, layer): the next inner
// installed layer's hook, or the game function the CALL reached originally. Layers have fixed positions (lower = outer),
// whatever order the modules install in:
//   - Install: the new layer's next pointer first; then either the CALL is rewritten to it (it becomes the outermost) or
//     the next outer layer's next pointer is re-pointed to it (one atomic store).
//   - Remove: the reverse; when the last layer goes, the original CALL bytes are written back.
//   - The 5 bytes are written only with every other thread suspended and none of them stopped inside them
//     (MemPatch::WriteCodeSuspended). A removed hook keeps its next pointer, so a thread still inside it finishes normally;
//     hooks stay in memory for the process lifetime.
//   - Before the first write the CALL must reach the game function the address table gives; later, the hook Apex wrote.
//     Anything else (another module redirected it) makes Install fail and is never overwritten by Remove.
// Used by the Frame Profiler (dev build, the outer layer, "Scene pending nodes" counter) and the scene node budget
// (features/scene_budget.h) on Scene::BeginFrame's CALL of the pending-node drain. Thread-safe (Install / Remove
// serialise on one mutex; Next is lock-free).
