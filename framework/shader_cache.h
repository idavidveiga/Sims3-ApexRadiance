// Apex's own HLSL shaders, compiled off the render thread (docs/architecture.md, "Shader precompile").
//
// Every feature registers each HLSL variant it can use (all qualities and modes) with Add(), from a namespace-scope
// initialiser in its own .cpp, so the whole list exists before the mod's init thread runs. Start() (init thread, right
// after the log opens, long before the device exists) compiles all of them with D3DCompile on one background thread and
// keeps the bytecode for the whole session. The render thread only creates the D3D9 shader objects from that bytecode
// (cheap) where the feature used to compile: at its first use, and again whenever the feature released them (Uninstall,
// Shutdown) - never compiling again.
//
// A request for a variant the worker has not finished yet makes the worker take that variant next and waits for it
// (logged and counted: it should not happen in practice, the precompile ends seconds after the game starts).
// D3D9 shader objects survive a device Reset; the features that release them anyway recreate them from the kept bytecode.
