// Exception safety nets where the game or the D3D9 runtime calls into Apex (07/10, players' "Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime
// Library: Runtime Error! ... terminate it in an unusual way"). A C++ exception (bad_alloc, length_error, a filesystem
// error ...) that leaves an Apex hook unwinds into game frames that cannot handle it, and the game ends. Each net catches
// it, notes where without allocating (the catch may run with no memory left), lets the game do what it would have done
// without Apex, and turns that one call site off so it does not throw again every frame. The notes reach the log later,
// from Present (ReportPending), outside any catch block.
